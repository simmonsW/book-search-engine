  ## Use
  Users can use the search bar to look up whatever books they may wish. If a user chooses to sign up, they will then be able to save their favorite books and view them by clicking `See Your Books` up in the upper left corner. Once done, users can navigate back to the search page by clicking `Search For Books`, Or logout altogether by clicking `Logout`.
