  ## Installation
  Clone this repo to wherever you want on your machine. Once cloned, navigate to the root of the project in the command line. From there, run the command `npm install` or `npm i`. Using concurrently, this will install all of our necessary dependencies in the client and the server sub-directories.

  ## How to Use
  Users can use the search bar to look up whatever books they may wish. If a user chooses to sign up, they will then be able to save their favorite books and view them by clicking `See Your Books` up in the upper left corner. Once done, users can navigate back to the search page by clicking `Search For Books`, Or logout altogether by clicking `Logout`.
